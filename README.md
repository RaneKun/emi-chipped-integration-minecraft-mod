## Credits

This mod is built on top of two excellent mods:

- **[EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi)** — A modern recipe viewer and item list mod for Fabric. All recipe display functionality is powered by EMI.
- **[Chipped](https://modrinth.com/mod/chipped)** — A decorative block mod by **Terrarium** (Organization), adding 7 workbenches with hundreds of block variant recipes. All recipe data comes from this mod.

Full credit for the underlying systems goes to the authors of these two mods. This integration mod simply connects them together.
